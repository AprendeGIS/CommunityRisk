risk_score;Risk score;(1-10 score);decimal2;resilience.png;Index of various indicators: see underlying indicators for source year.;Index of various indicators: see underlying indicators for source link.;This risk score is a 1-10 score which combines all underlying indicators into one index, comparable accross communities. It is made up of three main pillars: vulnerability, hazards exposure and coping capacity. The method and conceptual framework are derived from the INFORM model (www.inform-index.org), which applies it on a national level instead of a sub-national / community level. 
vulnerability_score;Vulnerability;(1-10 score);decimal2;vulnerability.png;Index of various indicators: see underlying indicators for source year.;Index of various indicators: see underlying indicators for source link.;The vulnerability pillar contains information on vulnerability: relative socio-economic status, but also inequality and presence of specific vulnerable groups. You can inspect which indicators are included at present, by clicking through the carousel. More relevant indicators will be added once available.

coping_capacity_score;Coping Capacity;(1-10 score);decimal2;coping.png;Index of various indicators: see underlying indicators for source year.;Index of various indicators: see underlying indicators for source link.;The hazards exposure pillar contains information on the relative risk of various types of hazards happening. You can inspect which indicators are included at present, by clicking through the carousel. More relevant indicators will be added once available. Specifically, besides natural hazards also conflict data can be integrated.

In this case a magnitude of 7 is taken for earthquakes to be included. Divided by the 2015 population census data, to get the relative exposure instead of the absolute number of people affected.

good_governance_index;Good governance index;Index (see info);decimal2;governance.png;2008;http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ggi/;Data from National Statistics Office, which aims to create an index of good governance per municipality (see 'Technical notes' in the source url). Max. score is 841 and min. score is 18. The latest release from this source is from 2008 unfortunately, therefore this indicator should be interpreted with caution and will be updated when possible. Nonetheless, it gives some insight in the distribution of good governance over the country.
traveltime;Travel time to nearest city;minutes;decimal0;traveltime.png;2000;http://forobs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/products/gam/download.php;Global grid dataset which estimates the travel time in minutes to the nearest city of at least 50k inhabitants. Even though the source is from 2000, this source is still a strong indicator of the remoteness of a community, and thus the relative availability or absence of facilities needed for coping capacity.
