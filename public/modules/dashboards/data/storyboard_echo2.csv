problem;Problem;The Problem;The ECHO2 project;"<p>The ECHO2 project is a Disaster Risk Reduction project carried out in Southern Malawi by the Red Cross. 
            For this project a selection of participating communities must be made, as there is no budget to include all.

problem;Problem;The Problem;Community selection in humanitarian projects;"<p>While the objective is to include high-risk communities, selection of project areas in such projects is often 
            fairly intransparent, with possibly subjective mechanisms at work and no guarantee that the most-at-risk communities 
            are included.

            <p>For this project 3 Traditional Authorities (administrative level 3) within 3 Districts (administrative level 2) have already been identified.

solution;Solution;A Data-driven solution;Open Data;"<p>A world that is producing more and better data every year, gives an opportunity to contribute to this prioritization process with a data-driven solution. 
            This enables us to collect datasources ranging from flood and drought risk to socio-economic circumstances on a very geographically detailed level.
            </p>";modules/dashboards/img/storyboards/echo2/background_echo2.png
solution;Solution;A Data-driven solution;INFORM Risk Index;"<p>All these various datasources can be combined into a composite risk index. 
            There are potentially many ways to do this, but a good and accepted framework is the <a href=""www.inform-index.org"" target=""_blank"">INFORM Risk Index</a>. 
            This framework has three main risk components: Hazards Exposure (how likely and large are disasters happening to an area), 
            Coping Capacity (what capacity does the area have in terms of institutions and infrastructure to cope with the resulting damage) and 
            Vulnerability (how vulnerable is the population living in the area already).
            </p>";modules/dashboards/img/storyboards/echo2/background_echo2.png
solution;Solution;A Data-driven solution;Priority Communities in ECHO2 project;"<p>The INFORM framework is initially developed on a national level, assigning one risk-score to each country in the world. 
            Recently, they are also developing sub-national models for some countries on provincial or municipal level. 
            For the ECHO2 project we want to go even deeper, and develop a risk-index for each Enumeration Zone within a Traditional Authority.
            These Enumeration Zones are zones that are used by the Malawi National Statistics Office (NSO). On this very deep geographical level
            we collect data sources on all components of the INFORM framework: hazards, vulnerability and coping capacity.

data;Data & Methodology;Data & Methodology;Enumeration Zones;"<p>The prioritization is done on Enumeration Zone level, as there are no other official boundaries below the Traditional Authorities 
            in Malawi. Enumeration Zones are used by NSO for census and survey work. Boundaries are found <a href=http://www.masdap.mw/layers/geonode%3Aeas_bnd"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

data;Data & Methodology;Data & Methodology;Hazards: Droughts and Floods;"<p>ECHO2 is specifically focused at areas prone to flood and/ or drought, which are the main natural hazards in Malawi anyway. 
            We are disregarding other potential hazards, which are normally included in INFORM, therefore. 
            </p>
            <h4>Droughts</h4>
            <p>The drought risk map was created by analyzing rainfall data in the past 20 years using standard precipitation index (SPI) , which is a widely used index in drought analysis. Based on SPI6 values for the period October-march, which is the main rainy season in Malawi. Each pixel is classified to drought or no drought for each year based on SPI6 values, drought year if SPI value for a pixel is less than -1. Next, relative frequency is calculated, the number of times drought has occurred in the considered 20 year period. This frequency is then converted to probability of drought occurrence in a given year. We validated our analysis by comparing NDVI values for the drought year against long term average values.           
            </p>
            <h4>Floods</h4>
            <p>To identify flood moments in Malawi Landsat imagery was studied (1984-2017). Floods were clearly evidenced in 9 dates. For the clearest and most representative layers the mNDWI (modified Normalized Water Index) was calculated. The index mNDWI (McFeeters 1996; Xu 2006) for Landsat bands is calculated as follows: (b2GREEN-b7MIRSWIR/b2GREEN+b7MIRSWIR). In this variation of the index the higher values are the wettest. A threshold was applied to the mNDWI to separate flood from non-flood or water from non-water pixels. The resulting layers were aggregated and the final stretched from 0-10, where 0 are the pixels where no flood is expected while pixels with 10 are where most frequent flood has been evidenced and therefore expected. The largest flood was observed in 2015, as the scenes were cloudy the flood extent was manually interpreted from several scenes. The evidenced flood dates are: 29 Feb. 1988 low flood, 19 march 1989, 17 march 1997, Feb 1998, March 1999 low flood, 2001 since February 16 until end of April, 2007 17 February since early Feb., 2008 Feb. medium flood, 2015 January – March. The water bodies in this layer are not represented and have a value of 0 like the rest of land where flood is absent.

data;Data & Methodology;Data & Methodology;Vulnerability: Poverty;"<p>Vulnerability is in this exercise represented by Poverty Incidence. Even though it is recognized that INFORM-framework and the general contains many more vulnerability-indicators, 
            the reality of the matter is that at this detailed level no other data is available. However, it must also be recognized that poverty incidence is potentially 
            the most important indicator of vulnerability, most closely relating to vulnerability itself.
            </p>
            <p>Poverty is retrieved from <a href=""http://www.worldpop.org.uk/data/summary/?doi=10.5258/SOTON/WP00157"" target=""_blank"">WorldPop</a>

data;Data & Methodology;Data & Methodology;Coping Capacity: Remoteness;"<p>Coping Capacity is in this exercise represented by Remoteness: the traveltime to the nearest hospital, secondary school and trading centre.
            Together, these are all important facilities, the proximity of which enables coping capacity. Moreover, it is expected that 
            these remoteness indicators are also good proxy indicators of even more facilities: if the closest hospital is far away, it is likely 
            that the closest Red Cross branch is also far away for example. 
            </p>
            <p>The travel times are calculated for each Enumeration Zones by combining point data on all hospitals, schools and trading centres in Malawi, 
            with full human settlement data, as well as the road network of Malawi. More information can be found <a href=""https://www.510.global/developing-and-field-testing-a-remoteness-indicator-in-malawi/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.
