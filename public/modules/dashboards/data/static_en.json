However, given limited funding, humanitarian actors cannot reach all people in need. They have to identify the geographic areas that are most affected by a humanitarian disaster or crisis and, within those areas, the individuals that are most in need. Currently, this prioritization process takes time and can be subjective. The Community Risk Assessment dashboard forms a data-driven alternative solution.",
