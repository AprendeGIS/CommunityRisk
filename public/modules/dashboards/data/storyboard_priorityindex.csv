problem;Problem;The Problem;Typhoon Haima;"<p>On Tuesday 18th October typhoon Haima (local name Lawin) made landfall above Luzon in the Philippines. Haima is the 2nd typhoon in 2016 to reach the country and is the first Super Typhoon since typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Sustained windspeeds up to 215 kilometers per hour were recorded.</p><p>Typhoons cause a lot of damage to houses, livelihoods (crop fields) as well as lives of course. The 15 (super) typhoons in The Philippines since 2010 on average caused PHP15.7 billion (USD 353 million) and 710 dead or missing.</p>

problem;Problem;The Problem;Humanitarian Response;<p>Immedidately after a typhoon hits, humanitarian organizations – including the Philippine Red Cross – get into action to assess damage and start relief operations. It is of course vital to know where to start these early assessments and operations. Typhoons, more so than for example earthquakes, can span a very large disaster area, in which it is unclear where damage is highest, and thus where priority needs to be.</p>;modules/dashboards/img/storyboards/priorityindex/philippines-ducks.png;70%
problem;Problem;The Problem;Current priority process;"<p>In the current process, damage counts are collected bottom up through government units. Barangay-leaders report numbers to municipalities, who in turn inform provincial governments, who report to the NDRRMC. Red Cross early assessment teams are sent out to selected areas for validation. This process takes at least a week to get a rough overview of where the highest damage is, and at least two weeks to get a full overview. Moreover, the process to get this overview is often intransparent, which allows for biases, and often comes with incompleteness, where some municipalities seem to indicate no damage, while they are surrounded by high-damage neighbours. So both in terms of speed and quality, there is a lot to be gained in this process.</p>

solution;Solution;A Data-driven solution;Open Data;"<p>A world that is producing more and better data every year, gives an opportunity to contribute to this prioritization process with a data-driven solution. For example, detailed satellite data on windspeed and rainfall is available vert quickly after typhoons. Also detailed level on pre-disaster data, such as population, wall and roof materials and geographic information like elevation is avilable.</p>

solution;Solution;A Data-driven solution;Machine Learning models;"<p>Our model looks at historical typhoons to find a predictive relationship between damage and pre- and post-disaster indicators such as windspeed, building material type and elevation. The found relationships can subsequently be applied to predict the damage for this new typhoon as well.</p>

solution;Solution;A Data-driven solution;Faster and more objective insight into Priority Areas;"<p>This analysis is done within 12 hours of the typhoon. This means that already after 12 hours - instead of having to wait for early assessment results - there is already detailed insight into where most damage occured and thus what priority areas are. Moreover, this analysis is completely objective and is therefore not subject to possible exaggerating of damage for by local government units to attract more aid.</p>

data;Data;Data;What is damage?;<p>Priority is measured in terms of damaged houses. First of all, damaged houses are in itself an important component of overall damage and thus priority. Second of all, a high proportion of damaged houses is probably also an indicator of damage of other types, such as livelihood damage. We do realize that this is not a perfect indicator though, it could be that crop fields are destroyed, while houses are not. But at the moment there is no good local data available on livelihood damage, and there is on house damage. In the future we will incorporate other types of damage where possible.</p><p>Damaged houses are recorded separately in completely damaged and partially destroyed houses. In our analysis, we also predict these two types of damage separately, resulting in # of completely damaged houses per municipality and '# of partially damaged houses per municipality'. Ultimately we do base the priority ranking on the sum of the two, for sake of simplicity. In the dashboard containing the results you can inspect them separately though.</p><p>Note also that priority is based on a combination of the absolute number of damaged houses and of the percentage of total houses that is damaged. If only the former, priority would always go to cities with many houses, while if the latter, some very low-populated municipalities could be prioritized thereby missing big chunks of people who actually need help.</p>;modules/dashboards/img/storyboards/priorityindex/damage.png;70%
data;Data;Data;Municipality level;We prioritize at the municipality level. This is the lowest level possible, because main data sources are only available on municipality level. Most importantly, the damage reports on historical typhoons.;modules/dashboards/img/storyboards/priorityindex/municipality.png;70%
data;Data;Data;Included variables;"<h3>Windspeed</h3><p>We use a geographic map of 3-second sustained maximum windspeeds, which are provided by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and are prepared by Professor Mark Saunders from University College London. The windspeeds are transformed to municipality averages. </p><h3>Distance from typhoon path</h3><p>Distance from the typhoon path is measured as the closest distance in kilometers and is also provided through JTWC and UCL.</p><h3>Rainfall</h3><p>Rainfall is measured as the total accumulated rainfall in millimeters over the whole period that the typhoon was active. Source is <a href=""https://pmm.nasa.gov/data-access/downloads/gpm"" target=""_blank"">NASA GPM</a></p><h3>Building materials</h3><p>Roof and wall building material averages per municipality are available from the 2010 Population and Housing Census. Naturally, this is expected to have an influence on the damage extent.</p><h3>Geographic variables</h3><p>Also geographic variables, such as elevation and slope, but also the extent of coastline are included. The former to account for different typhoon behaviour in mountaineous areas, such as landslides. The latter to account for example for damge through storm surges.</p>";modules/dashboards/img/storyboards/priorityindex/windspeed_calc.png;70%

results;Results;Results;What is the accuracy of the model?;"<p>Prediction and estimation models always go with a certain amount of uncertainty. By looking at historical typhoons we can establish real and substantial relationships between damage on the one hand and variables like windspeed and building materials on the other hand. However, there will always be certain differences in damage that we cannot explain with the variables we have available. It is good to realize though that even an imperfect estimation tells us already a lot more, than having no estimation or basing it on 'gut feeling'. It is good to have an insight into the expected accuracy of the predictions, based on previous cases.</p>

A few areas of of improvement area:</p><ul><li>Including more historical typhoons, so that we have more datapoints to base our predictions for the new typhoon on, this will increase the accuracy of the model.</li><li>Including more relevant variables: for example, it is well noted that side effects of typhoons can be landslides, which can cause high local damage. This is at the moment not ideally reflected yet.</li><li>Move from municipality level to barangay level to make even more precise predictions.</li><li>Let us know you're ideas as well!</li></ul>;modules/dashboards/img/storyboards/priorityindex/nextsteps.png;25%
